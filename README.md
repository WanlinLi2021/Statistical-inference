# Statistical-inference with the GSS data (R)

## Data
The GSS is a personal interview survey and collects information on a wide range of demographic characteristics of respondents and their parents.
The basic GSS design is a repeated cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of non-institutionalized adults who speak either English or Spanish. Subsampling of nonrespondents is done to limit survey costs while maintaining a nationally representative sample. Each GSS formally includes an A sample and a B sample. The preferred interview mode is in-person; however, a few interviews will be done by telephone if an in-person contact cannot be scheduled.
Therefore, random sampling was used in this study. Because of its generalizability, correlation statements can be made by exploring this dataset.
